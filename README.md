# countries

# to run with php's webserver

1. /etc/hosts
   127.0.0.1 www.fionastest.com

2. cd countries
   php -S www.fionastest.com:8000

3. Browser:
   http://www.fionastest.com:8000
   
4. I was unable to test this application in an environment where I had access to be able to write to the /etc/hosts file, so if these        steps don't work for you, you can test this in the browser at http://fiona-bot.com/test2/
